It keeps track of my Twitter account's recent new followers and unfollowers.

In this project I've used Twitter API to get my current followers details and then filtering out who is new here added [new follower] and who is not here compared to the previously saved list [new un-followers]

Initially, I created it completely and tracked who followed me and who unfollowed me, As soon as the back-end was complete, I added the front-end.
